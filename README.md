# Melange for React Developers

A simple project template using [Melange](https://github.com/melange-re/melange)
with [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/).

## Quick Start

```shell
make init

# In separate terminals:
make watch
make serve
```

When running `make init`, you may encounter an error like this:

```
[ERROR] Could not determine which packages to install for this switch:
  * Missing dependency:
    - melange >= 2.0.0
    no matching version
```

To address this, first run `opam update`, then rerun `make init`.

### React

React support is provided by
[`reason-react`](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react/). The entry
point of the sample React app is [`src/Index.re`](src/Index.re).

## Commands

You can see all available commands by running `make help` or just `make`. Here
are a few of the most useful ones:

- `make init`: set up opam local switch and download OCaml, Melange and
JavaScript dependencies
- `make install`: install OCaml, Melange, and JavaScript dependencies
- `make watch`: watch for the filesystem and have Melange rebuild on every
change
- `make serve`: serve the application with a local HTTP server
